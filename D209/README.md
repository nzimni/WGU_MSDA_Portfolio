**WGU D209: Data Mining I – Course Overview & Performance Assessment**

**Course Focus**
The **Data Mining I** course expands predictive modeling into **nonlinear dimensions**, enhancing the capabilities of the **data analytics lifecycle**. Students implement **supervised models**, specifically **classification and prediction data mining models**, to uncover relationships among variables that may not be apparent with surface-level techniques.

**Competencies Covered**
- **Classification Data Mining Models** – Applying observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
- **Predictive Data Mining Models** – Implementing prediction models to identify hidden relationships among variables.
- **Data Mining Model Performance** – Evaluating model precision, accuracy, and comparison metrics.

---

**Performance Assessment**
This course includes **two practical assessments**:

**Task 1: Classification Analysis**
Students develop and answer a **research question** using one of two provided datasets (**medical or telecom churn**). They apply **k-nearest neighbor (KNN) or Naïve Bayes classification analysis**, splitting the data into **training and test sets** before performing classification.

**Task 2: Advanced Modeling**
Students refine their research question and apply **decision trees, random forests, or advanced regression techniques (lasso or ridge regression)** to analyze relationships within the dataset.

Each task requires:
- **Data cleaning and preparation**.
- **Exploratory data analysis** to identify patterns.
- **Model evaluation** using statistical metrics.
- **Presentation of findings** through a structured report and video demonstration.
