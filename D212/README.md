**WGU D212: Data Mining II – Course Overview & Performance Assessment**

**Course Focus**
The **Data Mining II** course builds on previous predictive modeling techniques by introducing **unsupervised learning methods**. Students explore **clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and market basket analysis** to uncover hidden patterns in data.

**Competencies Covered**
- **Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering** – Applying clustering techniques to group similar data points.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Reducing dimensionality to identify significant variables.
- **Market Basket Analysis** – Using association rules and lift analysis to predict patterns in data.

---

**Performance Assessment**
This course includes **three practical assessments**:

**Task 1: Clustering Analysis**
Students apply **K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering** to one of two provided datasets (**medical or telecom churn**). They:
- Select relevant variables.
- Generate a clustering model.
- Evaluate the model and communicate findings.

**Task 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
Students develop a **research question** and use **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset with over 50 features. They:
- Identify the number of principal components.
- Analyze variance explained by each component.
- Apply PCA-transformed data to answer their research question.

**Task 3: Market Basket Analysis**
Students perform **association rule mining** to uncover relationships between variables. They:
- Use **Apriori or FP-Growth algorithms**.
- Identify frequent itemsets and association rules.
- Evaluate lift and confidence metrics.

Each task requires **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and a structured report**, with some requiring a **video demonstration**.
