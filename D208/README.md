**WGU D208: Predictive Modeling – Course Overview & Performance Assessment**

**Course Focus**
The **Predictive Modeling** course at WGU introduces students to **multiple regression and logistic regression techniques** for data-driven decision-making. It emphasizes **statistical modeling, feature selection, and predictive analytics**.

**Competencies Covered**
- **Multiple Regression** – Applying regression models to analyze relationships between variables.
- **Logistic Regression** – Using classification techniques to predict categorical outcomes.

---

**Performance Assessment**
Students complete **two hands-on projects**:
1. **Task 1: Multiple Regression Modeling** – Developing a regression model to analyze numerical relationships in a dataset.
2. **Task 2: Logistic Regression Modeling** – Building a classification model to predict categorical outcomes.

Each task requires:
- **Data cleaning and preparation**.
- **Exploratory data analysis** to identify patterns.
- **Model evaluation** using statistical metrics.
- **Presentation of findings** through a structured report.
