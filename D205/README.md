The D205 Data Acquisition course at WGU strengthens students' Structured Query Language (SQL) skills and introduces them to foundational concepts in the data analytics lifecycle. 
The coursework focuses on relational databases, helping students develop data management, transfer, and manipulation expertise. 

Through this course, students gain proficiency in: 
- Assessing Data Properties: Examining datasets to understand their structure, quality, relationships, and limitations for effective analysis. 
- Building Data Models: Designing and implementing conceptual, logical, and physical database models to support data-driven decision-making. 
- Executing Table Operations: Performing various table manipulations and SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
   
Students complete a hands-on assessment that involves: 
1. Utilizing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin in a virtual machine environment. 
2. Importing external datasets into an existing database by integrating a `.csv` file as a new table. 
3. Creating structured data models to organize and document the databaseâ€™s schema. 
4. Running SQL queries to explore the dataset and answer a research-driven question of their design.
